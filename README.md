# Pixels Codex

This is a from-scratch project solely used to gain visibility on the objects in the Crypto Pixels game. I developed it primarily to have an overview of the ingredients needed to create such and such item.

You can find it live on [Pixelscodex.xyz](https://www.pixelscodex.xyz/).

## How build ?

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

After install, you can run the app in the development mode.\

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser & Enjoy !
